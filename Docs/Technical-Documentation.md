# Hitman Absolution & Sniper Challenge Server
This project emulates the server used by [Hitman: Absolution](https://store.steampowered.com/app/203140/Hitman_Absolution/) and the [Hitman: Sniper Challenge](https://steamcommunity.com/app/205930) and aims to restore all its features, including the Contracts feature.

# Getting started with the code
In order to get started with the code, you need to have one of the following IDEs/editors installed:
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended)
- Jetbrains Rider
- Visual Studio Code with [vscode-solution-explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer) (recommended) and [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) (required) installed.

On top of that, you need to have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) for your OS installed (**not** the Runtime). The current project is based on .NET 6 LTS. You can however install any newer version you like.

## Getting starting with the hook
The hook supports both Hitman Absolution and Hitman Sniper Challenge depending on what you set in the `hook.ini`. Both allow to change the WebService URL. Hitman Absolution additionally allows you to skip the launcher.

The dinput8.dll hook is based on C++. It's beyond the scope of this document to explain how to compile that.

However, you can grab a precompiled copy from the `Bin\Hook` folder on this repository. Just drop it in the game folder along with the default `hook.ini` file, apply the desired changes and start the game.

The hook does not *crack* the games in any sort of way, you still need a legitimate copy in order to make use of this project.

# TODO
In its current state, almost everything is reverse engineered and working with mocked data. But there are still a few things to figure out to restore the full experience.

## Server
Phase 1:
- ~~Figure out if game can actually POST a body~~ Nope! It can't.
- ~~Figure out if GetFeaturedContract is actually used~~ Yes! After loading a level in Singleplayer. Will be shown on the in-game menu.
- ~~Figure out if GetScoreComparison is actually used~~ Yes! After loading a level in Singleplayer. Will be shown on the in-game HUD at the start of a level.
- ~~Figure out if __metadata is even needed anywhere~~ Nope! Doesn't seem like it at least.
- Figure out if SendTemplatedMessage is actually used.
- Add Unit Tests based on real requests made by the game.

Phase 2:
- Add EntityFramework and define a database schema
- Replace all mocked with actual functionality

Phase 3:
- Expose leaderboards through Web UI

## Hook
- Figure out how to patch Hitman Sniper Challenge without triggering anti-debugging measures to skip launcher.
- IDEA: Hook Steam Friends API to hook up own account system with friends.

# Notes about Ids in-game
- UserId is almost always a 64-bit SteamId. However, to stay on the safe side all UserId-properties are treated as a String.
- ContractId is considered a String in-game, since `Play_01` is used by the Contracts tutorial. This also has an effect on the LeaderboardId-properties, since that property can be a ContractId if the game wants to receive Contract-specific leaderboards.
    - IDEA: Use the hook to change these ID's to a negative number so the data model can keep using Integers.

# Notes about Messages in-game
Message are based on pre-determined localized texts that shipped with the game. In order to make a distinction between the title and the body of a message, these texts contain a `|||` as a separator, for example: `Title|||Body`.

The game allows the substitute parts of these texts by providing `TemplateData`. The game considers this property to be a key-value dictionary, but only if `TextTemplateId` is an actual valid Id.
A valid `TemplateData` that has two key-value pairs would be `Key1|||Value1|||Key2|||Value2`.

The game treats a few key-value pairs in a special way:
- `{ContractId}|||1` will enable the "Go To Contract"-button in-game and when clicked, opens up the contract with Id 1. This button won't be visible if this key-value pair is missing.
- `{userid}`, `{CompetitionCreatorName}` and `{WinnerName}` are used as the sender of the message if the `FromId`-property is missing.

All key-value pairs, even the ones above, can be used to substitute the key with the value in the eventual to-be-displayed text.

If you set the `TextTemplateId` to 0, the `TemplateData` will be considered the to-be-displayed text itself and does not allow any form of substitution. This causes a problem, as you will not be able to associate a contract with a message.

## Creating a custom message with an associated contract
Luckily, we can abuse the substitution system. All localized texts appear to have an entry for the word `Silverballer`. So by setting the `TextTemplateId` to that, we can effectively replace `Silverballer` with anything we want and provide a `{ContractId}` on top of that.

When the game converts `TemplateData` to a dictionary, it will search for the first `|||` it can find, then substring the value before it, skip past the `|||` and repeat. It expects to have an even number of substrings at the end, otherwise the game will crash.

This is problematic for the issue we want to solve, because if we try to replace `Silverballer` like this: `Silverballer|||<Title>|||<Body>`, it will cause an un-even number of substrings. So we have to do two substitutions the get the `|||` to be part of the final text, like this: `Silverballer|||<Title>||{Body}|||{Body}||||<Body>`.

Unfortunately, the `TemplateData` dictionary uses hashes to sort the key-value pairs, so on top of doing two substitutions, we also need to have the game do them in the right order. After some playing, this is the end result: `Silverballer|||<Title>||{baller}|||{baller}||||<Body>`. The only limitation now is that the contents of `<Title>` can't contain `{baller}`, but that seems acceptable.

This functionality is bundled in a suitably named `MasterCraftedSilverballer` method.

## Unused Messages
Even though we can create any message ourselves now, it's interesting to go through all the messages that could be used by the game.

Out of the hundreds of available messages, only a few were actually used by the game. Most of these can be recognized by the ALL CAPS titles.

The other ones tell an interesting story, as the message system was apparently supposed to have a much bigger role than it ended up getting. A few interesting concepts:
- Adding wagers to competitions, where the winner takes it all.
- Hitman players could join an agency, agencies would then have their own leaderboards.
- Agencies could be put up against each other in a Face-Off, what appears to be a global competition.

# Internal Documentation
This section aims to explain the inner workings of the game in relation to the API endpoints that need to be reverse engineered.

## Startup Phase
The first interesting calls happen here:
- `ZOnlineManagerWindows::Update`
- `ZOnlineManager::Update`
    - Called near a `_SteamAPI_RunCallbacks`-call
    - Contains a lot of timed events that call API endpoints regularly

If the webservice is not connected yet, it will call `ZOSWebService::Connect` followed by ` OSuite::ZOnlineSuite::CreateWebServiceClient`. In this function the configured service-url is passed to `OSuite::ZWebServiceClientManager::Create`.

Since there is no instance for this webservice yet, it will go into `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::Initialize`. This function registers the `os_getStatus` and `os_$metadata` endpoints with a callback to `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::InternalProbeResultCallback`. Eventually, `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::ProbeAvailability` is called.

`OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::ProbeAvailability` will prepare the request for the `os_getStatus` endpoint and use `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::InternalProbeCallback` as a callback. This callback is responsible for parsing the response.

If successfully parsed, `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::InternalProbeResultCallback` is called which will prepare the request to the `os_$metadata` endpoint with `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::InternalMetadataCallback` as a callback.

Unlike the `os_getStatus` request, a cache is used for the metadata and `OSuite::ZAtomCache::Open<OSuite::ZOMetadata>` will be called to fetch the result from the endpoint. The response is parsed (see the notes about `OSuite::ZAtomCache::Open` below) and the `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::InternalMetadataCallback` callback is called.

This function will check if a valid Metadata-response was given through `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::RetrieveRequest<OSuite::ZOMetadata>` and if there was, flag the ZWebServiceClient as connected (`m_eStatus = 2 //READY_STATE`)

## OSuite::ZAtomCache::Open
Something very important happens in any `OSuite::ZAtomCache::Open<T>`-function, as it will make an instance of a `TAtomObject<T>`. When the response comes back from the endpoint, this instance will get its `Read`-function called, which will then make an instance of the generic type.

There are a few of these `Read`-functions responsible for creating instances for:
- `OSuite::ZOEntry`
- `OSuite::ZOFeed`
- `OSuite::ZOMetadata`
- `OSuite::ZOServiceOperationResult`

Any of these constructors will call their respective `ParseJsonValue`-function.

## Invoking requests
- `ZOSServiceOperation::Invoke` with callback
    - Callback can be used to find the expected response-type based on usage of the following functions:
        - `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::RetrieveRequest<OSuite::ZOFeed>`
        - `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::RetrieveRequest<OSuite::ZOEntry>`
        - `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::RetrieveRequest<OSuite::ZServiceOperationResult>`
    - See ReturnType below to find out what to set ReturnType to.
- `ZOSQueryManager::Push` => `ZOSServiceOperation::Execute` => `OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::ExecuteQuery`

`OSuite::ZWebServiceClient::ExecuteQuery` will the try to get API endpoint. It bases this on the QueryMode, which can either be:
- QM_NONE //0
- QM_ENTITYSET //1
- QM_FUNCTIONIMPORT //2

## ExecuteQuery with QM_NONE
This will always generate an internal 404, which causes the webservice to disconnect and show the Disconnected-dialog in-game (this happens with the `ShowDialog` in `ZOnlineManager::Update`).

## ExecuteQuery with QM_FUNCTIONIMPORT
`OSuite::ZOMetadata::FunctionImport` will be called and if this fails an internal 404 is generated.

It will then check if the FunctionImport has all the querystring-parameters specified. If something is missing, again an internal 404 is generated.

Otherwise, it will continue and call the endpoint based on the data from the FunctionImport. It can make either a GET or a POST request (`HttpMethod`). Based on the `ReturnType` of the FunctionImport it will decide to either expect a `ZOEntry`, `ZOServiceOperationResult` or a `ZOFeed`.

## ExecuteQuery with QM_ENTITYSET
`OSuite::ZOMetadata::EntitySet` will be called and always result in a GET-request for a `ZOFeed`.

# ReturnType
These are the different ReturnType:
- SVOP_FEED = 0x0 => `OSuite::ZOFeed`
- SVOP_ENTRY = 0x1 => `OSuite::ZOEntry`
- SVOP_VALUE = 0x2 => `OSuite::ZOServiceOperationResult`
- SVOP_VALUECOLLECTION = 0x3
- SVOP_VOID = 0x4

The following pseudocode shows how the game will convert the value of the `ReturnType` on a `EdmFunctionImport` to a ReturnType enumeration value:
```
this->entityName = ReturnType;
this->returnType = SVOP_VOID;

var isEntityType = !this->entityName.Contains("Edm.")

if(this->entityName->StartsWith("Collection"))
{
	if(isEntityType) {
		this->returnType = SVOP_FEED
	}
	else {
		this->returnType = SVOP_VALUECOLLECTION
	}

	this->entityName = "Collection(this->entityName)"
}
else if(isEntityType) {
	this->returnType = SVOP_ENTRY
}
else {
	this->returnType = SVOP_VALUE
}
```

# JSON parsing
JSONTYPE_STRING = 0x0,
JSONTYPE_OBJECT = 0x1,
JSONTYPE_ARRAY = 0x2,

When `OSuite::ZAtomBase::ParseJson` is called:
- It will loop over all key-value pairs of the JSON-object that is passed in as the second argument.
- Each key-value pair will be passed to a `ParseJsonValue`-function, which is determined by the type of `ZAtomBase`-object passed in as the first argument.

There are a few of the `ZAtomBase`-objects in the game:
- `ZServiceOperationValue`
- `ZServiceOperationResult`
- `ZAtomFeed`
- `ZAtomEntry`
- `ZOMetadata`

The `ZOMetadata`-object is responsible for parsing the metadata-response from the API. It will call the `OSuite::ZOMetadata::ParseSchema`, which will call the `ParseJson`-function, which will call the `ParseJsonValue`-function of passed-in `ZEdmBase`-object.

There are a few of the `ZEdmBase`-objects in the game:
- `ZOEdmEntityType`
- `ZOEdmComplexType`
- `ZOEdmAssociation`
- `ZOEdmFunctionImport`
- `ZOEdmClientConfiguration`
    - NOTE: Instanced from `ZOMetadata->ParseJsonValue`

## ZOEntry
- ZOEntry is always an EdmEntityType
- Can contain a "results" which then contains the ZOEntry, but this is not required.

## ZOFeed
- ZOFeed appears to support object and literal value. Not sure about array.
- object should contain a "results" and "__count", results is then treated as an array of ZOEntry.

## ZOServiceOperationResult
- ZOServiceOperationResult can be a single value or an array of values
- All values will be converted to a ZServiceOperationValue
- In-memory a ZOServiceOperationResult is always a list of 1 or more ZServiceOperationValue
- ZServiceOperationValue can be a single value or an object

# Scratchpad
These are just some random notes.
- `OSuite::ZOEntry::ParseJsonValue`, `OSuite::ZOFeed::ParseJsonValue` and `OSuite::ZOServiceOperationResult::ParseJsonValue` describe how to parse their respective type.
- The use of `OSuite::ZOEntry::Property` describes an expected property on a `ZOEntry`.
- The second argument of `OSuite::ZOQuery::EntitySet` is the name of the expected EntitySet,
- The first argument of `ZOSServiceOperation::Invoke` is the name of the expected `EdmImportFunction`
